# Zk_Based_Age_Verification
Age verification tool using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) is a secure and privacy-preserving solution that allows users to prove their age without revealing their actual birthdate or sensitive personal information. It employs cryptographic techniques to generate and verify proofs, ensuring that the user's age meets certain criteria without exposing their private data. This tool has applications in various sectors, including online age-restricted services, healthcare, and more, 
where privacy and accurate age verification are crucial.
